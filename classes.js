//## Question 3

//a. Create a `Dog` class with four properties: `name (string), breed (string), mood (string), and hungry (boolean)`.

//b. Add a method called `playFetch`. It should set the dog's `hungry` property to `true`, set its mood property to `playful`, and log "Ruff!"

//c. Add a method called `feed`. If the dog is hungry, it should set `hungry` to `false` and print "Woof!" If the dog is not hungry, it should log "The dog doesn't look hungry"

//d. Add a method called `toString` that returns a description of the dog:
class Dog{

  this.breed = breed
  this.mood = mood
  this.hungry = hungry

/*## Question 4

There are three common scales that are used to measure temperature: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin:

C = (F - 32) / 1.8
F = 1.8 * C + 32
K = C + 273

a. Make an object called `freezingPoint` that has three properties: `celsius`, `fahrenheit`, and `kelvin`. Give them all values equal to the freezing point of water.*/
let freezingPoint = {
  celsius:0,
  fahrenheit:32,
  kelvin:273.2

//b. Make a class called `Celsius` that has one property: `celsius`, and two methods `getFahrenheitTemp`, and `getKelvinTemp`.
//c. Give `Celsius` a method called `isBelowFreezing` that returns a `Bool` (true if the temperature is below freezing).
class Celsius{

a. Create a class called `Movie` that has properties for `name`, `year`, `genre`, `cast`, and `description`. Create an instance of your `Movie`*/

let movie = new Movie("Moulin Rouge",2008,"romance","Jack Roberts",`woman who falls in love with a man who saves her from drowning`)

//b. Create a method inside `Movie` called `blurb` that returns a formatted string describing the movie.

//Ex: "Borat came out in 2006. It was an odd film starring Sacha Baron Cohen as a man named Borat who was visiting America from Kazakhstan."

console.log(movie.blurb())

/*  Question 6

Write a constructor Vector that represents a vector in two-dimensional space.
It takes two number arguments: `x` and `y` parameters, which it should be saved to properties of the same name.

Give the Vector prototype two methods, `plus` and `minus`, that take another vector as an argument and
returns a new vector that has the sum or difference of the two vectorsâ€™ (the one in `this` and the parameter) x and y values.

Add a method `getLength` to the prototype that computes the length of the vector ;
that is, the distance of the point (x, y) from the origin (0, 0).(a^2 + b^2 = c^2)

/*## Question 7

a. Make a class called `Car` with properties `make` and `model`.  Create an instance of a `Car`

b. Make a class called `Bike` with properties `gears` and `hasBell`.  Create an instance of `Bike`

c. Give each class a static method called `numberOfWheels` that returns the number of wheels (2 for bikes, 4 for cars).  Why does it make sense for this to be a static method instead of an instance method?
//Because you wouldn't want the method to change for an instance you want the method to be the same for all instances.
